# # Recycling Techniques
#
# The design of preparative chromatography poses major challenges in balancing the interdependence of product purity and yield, as well as the efficiency of the column and its pressure drop.
# To improve difficult separations, it may be necessary to increase the column's separation efficiency by using a longer column or reducing the particle size of the stationary phase.
# However, using a longer column or a particles can result in an excessively high pressure drop.
# To overcome this issue, several recycling techniques exist to effectively improve the separation.
# By connecting the column's outlet to its inlet, the separation can pass through the column multiple times, without the need for a longer column or smaller particles, and hence, with a manageable pressure drop.
#
# In the following different recycling concepts are introduced.
